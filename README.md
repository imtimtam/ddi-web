**Drug Library** is a responsive web application for exploring drugs, identifying potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs), and reviewing shared receptor targets. The site integrates with a FastAPI backend that processes multi-million row pharmacological and FDA datasets, enabling accurate and scalable results across thousands of drugs and reported adverse events. The API can be found [here](https://github.com/imtimtam/ddi-api).

## Demo Features
- **Drug Interaction Search**: Enter two drugs to check for potential interactions from a backend API.
